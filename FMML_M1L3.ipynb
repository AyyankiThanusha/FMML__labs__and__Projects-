        "The best values for angle and shear constraints in data augmentation can vary significantly depending on the specific dataset and task at hand. Here are some general guidelines:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Angle Constraint\n",
        "- **Best Value:** Typically ranges from -15 to +15 degrees for rotation in image datasets, but it may vary based on the nature of the images (e.g., more rotation for natural scenes, less for faces).\n",
        "- **Impact on Accuracy:** Using rotation augmentation within this range can improve accuracy by 2-10%, depending on the dataset's original variability and how much rotation reflects real-world scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Shear Constraint\n",
        "- **Best Value:** A shear angle of around -10% to +10% is commonly effective. Again, the exact range may depend on the dataset's characteristics.\n",
        "- **Impact on Accuracy:** Shearing can contribute to similar accuracy improvements as rotation, often in the range of 1-8%.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Accuracy Improvement\n",
        "- **Without Augmentation:** Baseline accuracy can vary widely, but let’s assume a starting accuracy of around 70-80% for a well-trained model on a small dataset.\n",
        "- **With Augmentation:** After implementing angle and shear augmentations, it is not uncommon to see improvements bringing accuracy up to 80-90% or more, depending on the dataset and the model architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "The optimal values for angle and shear constraints depend on the dataset and the specific problem domain. Typically, small ranges around ±15 degrees for angle and ±10% for shear yield good results, with potential accuracy improvements of 1-10% compared to models without augmentations. It’s essential to experiment with these values on your specific dataset to find the best configurations."
